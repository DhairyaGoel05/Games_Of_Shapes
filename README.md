# Games_Of_Shapes
This project is a simple web-based interactive game featuring different geometric shapes. Each shape has unique hover effects, adding an engaging and visually appealing interaction for users. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional for future enhancements) to create a minimalistic and dynamic design.

## Features
- **Interactive Shapes**: Three shapes are displayed: a square, a diamond, and a circle.
- **Hover Effects**: Each shape changes color when hovered over:
  - Square turns **red**.
  - Diamond turns **blue**.
  - Circle turns **green**.
- **Responsive Design**: Shapes are centered and adapt to various screen sizes.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file defining the styles, layout, and hover effects.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhairyaGoel05/shapes-game.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Hover over the shapes to see the interactive effects.

## Future Enhancements
- Add JavaScript functionality for advanced interactivity (e.g., click-to-change color, drag-and-drop).
- Include a scoring system for gamified interaction.
- Introduce additional shapes and animations.
